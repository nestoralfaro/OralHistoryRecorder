# OralHistoryRecorder

## Brief summary of what the app does
This prototype is divided as follows:

**Recording Part:**
- Record, re-record and pause recording.
- Play, stop, and slide at a specific time the audio just recorded.
- Remove the audio you just recorded.
- Add tags to the audio file–e.g., name, chapel, club stuff, decade.

**Administrator Part:**
- Login and creating administrator user.
- Implements data-binding when displaying the recordings–i.e., displays title and the audio file's tags.
- Ability to play, slide at a specific time, stop, and remove the selected audio file.

Learning objectives accomplished:
1. Use MVVM architecture with data binding between the View and ViewModel
2. Use a third-party library for reading and writing mp3 metadata
3. Store all mp3 files in ApplicationData.LocalFolder
